# ⚒️ The Artifact Foundry
(Working in progress)

This repository is my personal workshop. I treat my career as a craft that requires deliberate practice and a constant return to the basics. Everything here is a result of me getting my hands dirty to understand how things actually work—not just how they are used.

Beyond being a workspace, this is how I organize my knowledge. I am sharing my process, the artifacts I've built, and the structure I use to keep pace with the field without losing sight of the foundations.

### Philosophy

This repository values:
- **Understanding over completion**: Deep comprehension beats surface-level coverage
- **Implementation over theory**: Build it to truly understand it
- **Fundamentals over frameworks**: Master the basics, frameworks will follow
- **Quality over quantity**: One well-understood concept beats ten memorized facts
